 Dr. Brad Worthington has dedicated his life's work to bringing BKK to the world and preventing the next generation from becoming exposed to opioids. In order to do this, he has invested a significant portion of his retirement fund and spent two decades of his professional career pushing it forward. With the cost of maintaining his current patent at $25,000 and a total of $150,000 already spent, Worthington and his partner, Thurman, must now decide which path to take in order to bring BKK to market. The three options available are to license the drug to a pharmaceutical company, to form a joint venture with a pharmaceutical company, or to form an independent company to market the drug. Each of these options has its own advantages and disadvantages, and must be carefully considered in terms of cost, availability, and effectiveness. 

When considering cost, it is important to consider the upfront costs associated with each option. Licensing the drug to a pharmaceutical company would require the least amount of upfront costs, as the company would be responsible for the development and marketing of the drug. However, forming a joint venture or an independent company would require more upfront costs, as the company would need to cover the costs of development and marketing. Additionally, the cost of manufacturing and distributing the drug must be taken into account. 

In terms of availability, it is important to consider the potential reach of the drug. Licensing the drug to a pharmaceutical company would provide the greatest reach, as the company would have the resources to distribute the drug to a wide range of markets. Forming a joint venture or an independent company would provide a more limited reach, as the company would need to rely on its own resources to distribute the drug. 

Finally, when considering effectiveness, it is important to consider the potential efficacy of the drug. Licensing the drug to a pharmaceutical company would provide the greatest potential efficacy, as the company would have the resources to conduct extensive research and development on the drug. Forming a joint venture or an independent company would provide a more limited potential efficacy, as the company would need to rely on its own resources to conduct research and development. 

Overall, it is clear that BKK has the potential to be a successful drug in the pharmaceutical industry. In order to bring BKK to market, the cost, availability, and effectiveness of the drug must be carefully considered. Licensing the drug to a pharmaceutical company would provide the greatest potential for success, as the company would have the resources to cover the costs of development and marketing, distribute the drug to a wide range of markets, and conduct extensive research and development on the drug. Therefore, I recommend that Worthington and Thurman license BKK to a pharmaceutical company in order to bring it to market.
