 In order to bring BKK to market, Dr. Worthington and his partner Thurman must commit to a path and decide which of the three options is the best choice. The first option is to license the drug to a pharmaceutical company, which would require a significant upfront cost and a long-term commitment. The second option is to form a partnership with a pharmaceutical company, which would require a smaller upfront cost and a shorter-term commitment. The third option is to self-fund the development and marketing of BKK, which would require the most upfront cost and the longest-term commitment. 

When considering the cost of each option, it is important to consider the cost of maintaining the patent, which is estimated to be $25,000. Additionally, the cost of developing and marketing BKK must be taken into account. Licensing the drug to a pharmaceutical company would require a significant upfront cost, while forming a partnership with a pharmaceutical company would require a smaller upfront cost. Self-funding the development and marketing of BKK would require the most upfront cost, as Dr. Worthington and Thurman would have to cover the cost of development and marketing. 

The availability of BKK is also an important factor to consider. Licensing the drug to a pharmaceutical company would make BKK widely available, as the company would have the resources to market and distribute the drug. Forming a partnership with a pharmaceutical company would also make BKK widely available, as the company would have the resources to market and distribute the drug. Self-funding the development and marketing of BKK would make BKK less widely available, as Dr. Worthington and Thurman would have to rely on their own resources to market and distribute the drug. 

Finally, the effectiveness of BKK must be taken into account. Licensing the drug to a pharmaceutical company would ensure that BKK is tested and approved by the FDA, making it a safe and effective option for patients. Forming a partnership with a pharmaceutical company would also ensure that BKK is tested and approved by the FDA, making it a safe and effective option for patients. Self-funding the development and marketing of BKK would not guarantee that BKK is tested and approved by the FDA, making it a potentially unsafe and ineffective option for patients. 

In conclusion, it is clear that the best option for Dr. Worthington and Thurman is to form a partnership with a pharmaceutical company. This option would require a smaller upfront cost and a shorter-term commitment, while also ensuring that BKK is tested and approved by the FDA, making it a safe and effective option for patients. Additionally, this option would make BKK widely available, as the company would have the resources to market and distribute the drug. Therefore, I recommend that Dr. Worthington and Thurman form a partnership with a pharmaceutical company in order to bring BKK to market.
