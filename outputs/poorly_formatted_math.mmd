writing $d y / d x$-which caught on. It is the perfect way to suggest the limit of $\Delta y / \Delta x$. Newton was one of the great scientists of all time, and calculus was one of the great inventions of all time-but the notation must help. You now can write and speak about the derivative. What is needed is a longer list of functions and derivatives.

The derivative is the a of $\Delta f / \Delta t$ as $\Delta t$ approaches Here $\Delta f$ equals $\quad$ c . The step $\Delta t$ can be positive or $\frac{d}{\text {. }}$. The derivative is written $v$ or $\theta$ or 1 . If $f(x)=\frac{d}{2 x+3}$ and $\Delta x=4$ then $\Delta f=\mathrm{g}$. If $\Delta x=-1$ then $\Delta f=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{}$. If $\Delta x=0$ then $\Delta f=\frac{1}{1}$. The slope is not $0 / 0$ but $d f / d x=1$.

The derivative does not exist where $f(t)$ has a $\mathbf{k}$ and $v(t)$ has a 1 . For $f(t)=1 / t$ the derivative is $\mathrm{m}$. The

12 Find the derivative of $1 / t^{2}$ from $\Delta f(t)=1 /(t+\Delta t)^{2}-1 / t^{2}$. Write $\Delta f$ as a fraction with the denominator $t^{2}(t+\Delta t)^{2}$. Divide the numerator by $\Delta t$ to find $\Delta f / \Delta t$. Set $\Delta t=0$.

15 Find numbers $A$ and $B$ so that the straight line $y=x$ fits smoothly with the curve $Y=A+B x+x^{2}$ at $x=1$. Smoothly means that $y=Y$ and $d y / d x=d Y / d x$ at $x=1$.

16 Find numbers $A$ and $B$ so that the horizontal line $y=4$ fits smoothly with the curve $y=A+B x+x^{2}$ at the point $x=2$.

17 True (with reason) or false (with example):

18 For $f(x)=1 / x$ the centered difference $f(x+h)-f(x-h)$ is $1 /(x+h)-1 /(x-h)$. Subtract by using the common denominator $(x+h)(x-h)$. Then divide by $2 h$ and set $h=0$. Why divide by $2 h$ to obtain the correct derivative?
